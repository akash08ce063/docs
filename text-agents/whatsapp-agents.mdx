# WhatsApp Agents Quickstart

Build your first WhatsApp agent and start messaging your customers through WhatsApp 🚀

You will:

-   Set up your WhatsApp Business credentials
-   Connect your WhatsApp number to Pranthora
-   Configure your webhook
-   Add intelligence to power your agent

---

## 🧩 Prerequisites

-   A Meta developer account
-   Access to [Meta for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/)
-   A WhatsApp Business number (test number works fine)

> 💡 Tip: If you’re brand new to the WhatsApp Cloud API, keep the Meta docs open in a separate tab for quick reference.

## 1. Get Your WhatsApp Credentials

To get started, you need these three values from Meta:

-   Phone Number ID
-   Access Token
-   WhatsApp Business Account ID

If you haven't set up WhatsApp Business yet, follow Meta’s setup to create an app and obtain these credentials.
