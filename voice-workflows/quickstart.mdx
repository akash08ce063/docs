# Voice Workflow Quickstart

This guide will help you create your first **voice workflow** and configure it for agent interactions. üéõÔ∏è

---

## üß© Step 1: Create a Workflow

1. Visit the [Workflow List](https://app.pranthora.firstpeak.ai/workflow-list).
2. Click **Create Workflow** to initiate a new workflow.

---

## üìù Step 2: Add Introduction Node

* An **Introduction Node** will be auto-created.
* Add a prompt to guide the initial conversation. For example:

```text
Acknowledge the user's voice agent use case, then ask for information about the user. Check if the user is available to talk.
```

* Click **Save** to confirm your node.

---

## üîÄ Step 3: Create Condition & Conversation Nodes

1. Add a **Condition Edge** from the Introduction Node:

   * Example condition: `User is free`
2. Connect it to a **Conversation Node**:

   * Example prompt: `If user is interested in attending workshop, proceed with relevant details.`
3. Click **Save** to store the configuration.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 4: Global Configuration

On the **right side** of the workflow screen, you will find **Global Configuration** options:

* **LLM Model** ‚Äî select the model to be used throughout the workflow.
* **Transcriber** ‚Äî choose the speech-to-text provider.
* **Text to Speech** ‚Äî configure the voice for agent responses.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** These three configurations apply **globally across all nodes** in the workflow. They remain consistent for the entire conversation flow.
