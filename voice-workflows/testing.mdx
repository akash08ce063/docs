# Voice Workflow Testing

Before deploying your **voice workflow** for production calls, you can test it using the built-in tools to ensure everything works as expected. üß™

There are two primary testing options:

* **Web Call** ‚Äî tests the full speech pipeline.
* **Chat** ‚Äî tests the workflow in text-only mode.

---

## üìû Web Call Testing

* In the **Workflow Configuration** screen, look to the **right side** for the **Start Call** button.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Make sure to **Save** the workflow configuration before starting the call to apply the latest changes.
* Click **Start Call** and begin speaking. The workflow will process your input through the configured nodes, transitions, and full speech pipeline.
