# Voice Workflow Terminologies

This page explains the **core components and terminologies** used when creating voice workflows in Pranthora. Understanding these concepts will help you design effective workflows for your agents.

---

## 🗨️ Conversational Node

The **Conversational Node** is responsible for conducting the dialogue with the user.

* Takes a **system prompt** to guide the conversation.
* Can have **multiple transition conditions**.
* If the node cannot handle a user query or identifies that another node is better suited, it will **automatically transition** to the appropriate node.

---

## 🛠️ Tool Node

The **Tool Node** handles interactions that require performing specific actions via tools.

* Gathers required **parameters from the user**.
* Makes **tool calls**, e.g., booking an appointment.
* Example parameters: `start time`, `patient name`, `duration of visit`.
* ⚠️ **Note:** Each Tool Node can only handle **one tool at a time**.

---

## 📞 Transfer Node

The **Transfer Node** is responsible for transferring the call to another number.

* Requires the **phone number** in **E.164 format**.
* Upon execution, the call is **transferred** to the specified number.

---

## ❌ End Call Node

The **End Call Node** terminates the conversation.

* When triggered, the call is **ended**.
* Use this node at the conclusion of a workflow.

---

## 🔀 Conditional Edges / Transition Conditions

Conditional edges define the **path between nodes** based on user intent.

* Represent **intents or conditions** that determine the next node.
* Connect multiple nodes together, forming a logical flow.
* If the user's intent **matches a condition**, the workflow transitions to the connected node.

> 💡 **Tip:** Plan your conditional edges carefully to ensure smooth conversation flow and correct intent handling.
