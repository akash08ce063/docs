title: Pipelines Overview

## Overview

In Pranthora, an agent interaction flows through a carefully designed **pipeline** that handles both **speech-based** and **text-based** conversations with high accuracy and responsiveness.

There are two primary types of pipelines:

- 🎙️ **Speech Pipeline** – Used for real-time voice conversations.  
- 💬 **Text Pipeline** – Used for chat-based or text-only interactions.

---

## 🎙️ Speech Pipeline

The **Speech Pipeline** powers natural and responsive conversations between users and agents.  
It processes the entire flow from a user’s voice input to an agent’s spoken response, following this sequence:

### 1. User Audio Input
User audio can originate from:
- **Twilio** (for phone calls)  
- **Web** (for browser-based calls)

The incoming audio is **resampled** to a consistent format and **noise cancellation** is applied to ensure clarity before further processing.

---

### 2. Voice Activity Detection (VAD)
The cleaned audio is analyzed through the **Voice Activity Detection (VAD)** stage.  
This stage identifies when the user starts and stops speaking — effectively detecting **turn boundaries** using a combination of:
- **Acoustic cues (voice energy, silence)**  
- **Semantic understanding (end-of-sentence meaning)**  

This ensures that the system knows precisely **when to respond** or **when to continue listening**.

---

### 3. Transcription
Once user speech is detected, it is sent to the **transcription model** in **streaming mode**.  
- The model generates **partial transcripts** in near real-time.  
- These transcripts are continuously updated and refined as the user speaks.  
- This enables the agent to start reasoning and responding without waiting for the user to finish completely.

---

### 4. Agent / Assistant Processing
The transcribed text is then passed to the **Agent (LLM/Assistant)**, which:
- Understands user intent.  
- Generates a contextual and relevant response.  
- Optionally performs **external tool or integration calls** (e.g., MCP, HTTP, or N8N workflows).  

During this step, the system keeps listening for **user interruptions** — if the user begins speaking again, the agent’s response is **interrupted and cleared**, allowing the system to immediately process the new input.

---

### 5. Text-to-Speech (TTS)
The agent’s text output is sent to the **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** module, which:
- Converts the text into natural-sounding audio.  
- Supports **streaming synthesis**, so the user hears the response with minimal delay.  

The result is a fluid, real-time, back-and-forth voice experience.

---

### 6. Assistant Audio Output
Finally, the generated speech is **streamed back to the user**, either through:
- The browser audio interface, or  
- A Twilio-powered phone call.  

This completes one full **speech interaction loop**, from user voice → agent reasoning → agent voice.

---

## 💬 Text Pipeline

The **Text Pipeline** is a simplified version of the speech pipeline — perfect for chat testing or text-based interfaces.

1. **User Text Input** – The user types a message directly.  
2. **Agent Processing** – The text is passed to the same LLM/assistant logic used in the speech pipeline.  
3. **External Calls** – Integrations and tool executions occur as needed.  
4. **Text Output** – The agent’s response is returned directly as text (no TTS step).

This pipeline mirrors the logic of the speech pipeline but excludes all voice-related components (audio input, VAD, transcription, and TTS).

## Summary

| Stage | Speech Pipeline | Text Pipeline |
|--------|------------------|---------------|
| Input | User voice (Twilio/Web) | Text message |
| Processing | VAD + Transcription + Agent + TTS | Agent only |
| Output | Agent voice (streamed) | Text reply |
| Interruption Handling | Dynamic speech interruption detection | Not applicable |

---

### ⚙️ Key Takeaways
- Both pipelines share the same **Agent intelligence and integration logic**.  
- Speech pipeline adds **real-time streaming**, **turn detection**, and **TTS playback**.  
- User interruptions are handled gracefully, ensuring smooth and natural interaction flow.  
- Ideal for both **voice-first** and **text-first** conversational experiences.
