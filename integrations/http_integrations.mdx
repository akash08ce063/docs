title: HTTP Integrations
---

## Overview

HTTP integrations allow your agents and workflows to connect directly with external APIs through a simple, unified configuration interface.  
These integrations enable your voice agents to perform a wide range of actions — from fetching data to triggering automations — without manual coding.

---

## Connecting from Template Library

You’ll see a list of popular provider templates under the **Integrations Library** section.  
Simply click **Connect** on any provider you want to integrate.  
This will open a new tab asking you to sign in or authorize the connection.  

Once successfully connected, the integration will appear under your **Active Integrations** list and can be utilized across **Agents** or **Workflows**.

## Custom HTTP Integration

If the provider you need is not available in the list, you can add a **Custom HTTP Integration**.  
Click on **Add Custom HTTP**, and provide:

- **Base URL** of the API  
- **Authentication headers**  
- **Timeout configuration**

Once connected, the platform will automatically fetch the schema or endpoint definitions for easy use.  
These integrations behave just like any built-in ones and can be attached to any agent or workflow.

## Output Schema Control

Many external APIs return large payloads, often containing unnecessary fields.  
To simplify the response and make it more usable, you can define a custom **Output Schema** — selecting only the fields you want to keep.

For example:

> When fetching events from a calendar API, you might keep only `event_name` and `start_time`, trimming out other unneeded details.

This helps keep responses clean and relevant to your use case.

### Tip
> HTTP Integrations can be found alongside **MCP Integrations** and **N8N Workflows** tabs in your integrations dashboard.
