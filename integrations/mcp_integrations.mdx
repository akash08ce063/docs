MCP (Model Context Protocol) integrations allow your agents and workflows to connect with powerful external tools and data sources in a standardized, secure way.

You can read more about MCP and its protocol at [Model Context Protocol Documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/).

## ⚙️ Connecting MCP Integrations

From the **Integrations Library**, you can easily connect to one or more MCP servers.

1. Go to the **Integrations** page in the dashboard.
2. Select the **MCP** tab.
3. From the **Integrations Library**, click **Connect** on your desired MCP provider (for example, Gmail, Zendesk, or Trello).
4. A new tab will open prompting you to **sign in** and authorize the integration.
5. Once authorization is complete, you’ll return to the dashboard, and your **MCP server** will appear under **Active Integrations**.

## 🧩 Using MCP Integrations

Once connected, MCP integrations can be attached to:

* **Assistants** → to perform real-time actions like sending emails, fetching calendar events, or updating CRM data.
* **Workflows** → to automate multi-step tasks using contextual understanding and tool invocation.

You can explore available tools under each MCP integration by expanding the integration card.

> 💡 **Tip:** Each MCP integration can host multiple tools, so you can perform several actions within the same connected provider.

## 🧰 Adding a Custom MCP Integration

If your desired MCP provider is not available in the pre-listed options, you can easily add it as a **Custom MCP Integration**.

1. Click **Add Custom MCP** in the MCP integrations tab.
2. Provide the following details:
   * **MCP Server URL**
   * **Headers (optional)** — key-value pairs for authentication or custom metadata
   * **Timeout (in seconds)** — to control the connection duration
3. Once configured, the system will automatically **connect to the MCP server**, **fetch the schema**, and add it to your **Active Integrations**.

You can then use this integration like any other provider — attach it to assistants or workflows and start utilizing its tools immediately.

## 🔒 Authorization and Security

* MCP integrations use OAuth-based authentication where available.
* Credentials are securely stored and never exposed in plaintext.
* You can disconnect or revoke access at any time from the integration dashboard.
