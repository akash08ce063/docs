## üß© Using MCP Integrations

Once connected, MCP integrations can be attached to:

* **Assistants** ‚Üí to perform real-time actions like sending emails, fetching calendar events, or updating CRM data.
* **Workflows** ‚Üí to automate multi-step tasks using contextual understanding and tool invocation.

You can explore available tools under each MCP integration by expanding the integration card.

> üí° **Tip:** Each MCP integration can host multiple tools, so you can perform several actions within the same connected provider.

## üß∞ Adding a Custom MCP Integration

If your desired MCP provider is not available in the pre-listed options, you can easily add it as a **Custom MCP Integration**.

1. Click **Add Custom MCP** in the MCP integrations tab.
2. Provide the following details:

   * **MCP Server URL**
   * **Headers (optional)** ‚Äî key-value pairs for authentication or custom metadata
   * **Timeout (in seconds)** ‚Äî to control the connection duration
3. Once configured, the system will automatically **connect to the MCP server**, **fetch the schema**, and add it to your **Active Integrations**.

You can then use this integration like any other provider ‚Äî attach it to assistants or workflows and start utilizing its tools immediately.

## üîí Authorization and Security
