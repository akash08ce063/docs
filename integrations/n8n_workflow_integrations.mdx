title: N8N Integrations
---

## Overview

N8N integrations enable seamless automation by connecting your **Pranthora** agents and workflows to the powerful [N8N](https://n8n.io) automation platform.  
You can build and run complex automations that your agents can trigger through voice or chat interactions — without writing code.

## Setting Up N8N Integration

Before you can use N8N with Pranthora, you’ll need to connect your **N8N account**.  
Follow these steps to get started:

1. **Go to the N8N Integrations page**  
   Navigate to [Integrations](https://app.pranthora.firstpeak.ai/integrations) and select the **N8N** tab.

2. **Connect your N8N account**  
   If you haven’t connected before, you’ll be prompted to link your account.  
   Click **Connect Account**, and a new window will open for signing up or signing in to N8N.

3. **Retrieve your API key**  
   After signing in, go to your **N8N Dashboard → Settings (on left bottom) → N8N API** and copy your **API Key**.

4. **Paste your API key in Pranthora**  
   Return to the N8N Integrations page and paste the API key on text box.  
   Once added, your N8N account will be successfully linked with Pranthora.

## Cloning the Workflow Template

On the right-hand side of the integrations screen, you’ll find a **pre-built N8N workflow template**.  
This workflow is designed to help you get started quickly.

- Click **Clone Template** to duplicate the workflow into your N8N workspace.  
- Open the workflow in N8N, and **connect the provider credentials** (e.g., Google Sheets, HubSpot, or any third-party service).  
- Save and activate your workflow in N8N.

## Using N8N as a Tool

Once your workflow is cloned and active, it becomes available to use directly within your Pranthora **Agents** or **Voice Workflows**.  
When triggered, your agent will execute the N8N workflow automatically — enabling dynamic, multi-step automation powered by N8N.

---

## Summary

- Connect your N8N account  
- Provide your API key  
- Clone the prebuilt template  
- Link your providers in N8N  
- Use the N8N workflow as a tool inside Pranthora agents or workflows

### Tip
> You can customize the cloned N8N workflow at any time — modify nodes, add integrations, or define new automation paths to perfectly fit your voice agent use case.
