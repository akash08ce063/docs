## 2. Prepare your CSV 

    CSV must contain:
          - A column for to_phonenumber
          - Optional columns for variables referenced in the batch (must match variable names entered earlier).
          - **Phone number formatting**: Use E.164 format
    

    Tips:
        - Include a header row.
        - Trim spaces and remove hidden characters.
        - Validate phone numbers before upload to reduce errors.

    2. click **Upload** and select your CSV file.
    3. **(Optional)** Click **Template** to download a sample CSV. Use the template as your format reference.
    4. Map CSV columns to fields shown by UI (choose the to_phonenumber column and any variable columns).
    5. After Selecting a file ,  Preview a few rows (UI shows sample rows and warns about invalid numbers).

## 4. Launch Campaign

Once upload is processed and you confirm the contact count:
    1. Click Launch Campaign

What happens: Pranthora will schedule and begin calling contacts using the selected Agent/Workflow. Each call instantiates the agent and uses the variables from the CSV for personalization.

    💡 **Tip & Validations:**
        - Use E.164 phone formatting when possible (`+<countrycode><number>`).
        - If rows are rejected, download the errors or fix the CSV and re-upload only failed rows.
        - Test with a small batch_size first (e.g., 10) to verify agent behavior.
