## 🧩 Overview

Integrations allow your assistants to connect with external systems and perform real actions — from fetching data to automating workflows.
We provide **easy-to-setup integrations** that can be configured in just a few clicks.

Once an integration is set up, it becomes available to your agents for use directly from the dashboard.

---

## 🔗 Setting Up Integrations

1. Go to [Integrations Dashboard](https://app.pranthora.firstpeak.ai/integrations).
2. You’ll be offered three types of integrations — MCP, HTTP, and N8N.
From the Integrations Library, select your desired provider and click Connect to configure the provider.
3. Once configured, your integration will automatically appear in the **Integration section** of your agent’s settings as a **dropdown** option.
4. Select the integration for your assistant to start using it.

## ⚙️ Supported Integration Types

Currently, Pranthora supports the following integration types:

* **MCP Provider Integrations** — for connecting with standardized external APIs and tools through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
* **HTTP Integrations** — for direct API calls to web services or internal systems.
* **n8n Integrations** — to connect with hundreds of applications and workflows through [n8n](https://n8n.io/).

## 💡 Why Integrations Matter

Integrations form the **heart of the system** — enabling agents to:

* Perform real actions beyond conversation.
* Access external data sources.
* Automate workflows and respond intelligently in context.

> 🚀 The more integrations you connect, the more capable and context-aware your assistants become.
