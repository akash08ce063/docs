## 🧠 Model

In the **Model** section, you can configure how your assistant thinks and behaves.

* From the **dropdown list**, choose any available **model** of your choice.
* Adjust the **temperature** to control the variability in responses — lower values make the assistant more deterministic, while higher values make it more creative.
* Specify a **welcome message** to greet users when a call starts.
* Define a **greeting message** that the agent will speak at the start of the call exactly as written.

> 💡 **Use Case:** Use the model configuration to tailor your assistant’s tone, creativity, and initial conversation flow.

## 🎙️ Transcriber

The **Transcriber** listens to the caller’s voice and converts it into text for the model to understand.

* Select a **transcriber** provider from the available options.
* It transcribes spoken input into text for real-time understanding and response.

### ⚙️ Streaming Option

Each provider may have a **Streaming Enabled** toggle.
Enabling streaming allows the transcription to happen in **real time**, leading to faster and more natural conversations.

> ⚠️ **Important:** Most providers support **streaming mode**, which is preferred for smooth, low-latency conversations.
> The only exception is **Faster-Whisper**, which operates in **non-streaming mode**. Be cautious when changing this setting if using Faster-Whisper.

## 🔊 Text to Speech (TTS)

The **TTS** engine converts the assistant’s text responses into natural-sounding speech.

* Choose from a wide variety of **human-like voices** across different providers.
* You can configure the **voice style, gender, and accent** depending on the provider.
* There is also a **streaming mode** option, allowing speech to begin playback as it’s generated — improving response time and interactivity.

> 💡 **Recommendation:** Keep TTS in **streaming mode** for faster, more natural responses during real-time calls.
