# Testing

Before deploying your assistant to handle real production calls, you can **quickly test** it within the Pranthora dashboard. 🧪

Two primary testing options are available:

* **Web Call** — for testing full voice conversations.
* **Chat** — for testing text-only interactions.

---

## 📞 Web Call Testing

The **Web Call** feature allows you to test your agent’s full speech pipeline — including transcription, model response, and text-to-speech.

* In the **Configure Agent** screen, look to the **right side** of the interface.
* You’ll see the **Start Call** button.

> ⚠️ **Important:** Before clicking **Start Call**, make sure to **Save** your configuration so that the latest updates are applied.

Once saved, click **Start Call** — you can begin speaking, and your agent will respond in real time using its configured voice and logic.

---

## 💬 Chat Testing

If you prefer to test your assistant’s logic without using voice, use the **Chat** option available in the bottom-right corner of the same screen.

* The chat executes the **same underlying pipeline** (transcription, model reasoning, and response generation) — but operates purely in text form.
* Your inputs appear as text, and the agent’s responses will be displayed directly in the chat window.

## 💡 Tips

* Always verify that the latest configuration is saved before initiating any test.
* Use **Web Call** to experience the real-time voice behavior.
* Use **Chat** for faster iteration and debugging of prompt or logic changes.
